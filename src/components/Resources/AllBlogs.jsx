    <p>But science has its own explanation on this glowing phenomenon. Science says that, The Fireflies light up due to the organic chemical present in their abdomen called Luciferin. Every time the air rushes into their abdomen, the chemical reacts with the air and lights up. This is also called Bioluminescence.</p>

    <p> Another theory proposes thatFireflies produce defensive steroids in their bodies that make them unpalatable to predators. Larvae use their glows as warning displays to communicate their distastefulness. Well let us decide for ourselves which side to believe the saying or science!

    Nothing in the world occurs without a reason, the fireflies too have their own reason for lighting up, the reason none other than, Mating!. Light is dissipated by the amazing creatures in order to attract the opposing sex. Male fireflies send signals in the form of different flashing light patterns, which females reply to in their own way. For bystanders, the exchange of light creates a captivating phenomenon. The flies survive long enough to reproduce and lay eggs, and then they die.
